I don't think you need to include the constructor on any of them Because
it is listed at the beginning what would go in the constructor

Also don't forgoet to add "+" for public functions and "-" for private functions
mainly in your constructor box area
EX: "__function" would be considered private

NumberSet
* This all looks good, if your following the starter code you would need a size
in the constructor but I assume you have a good plan.

Card
* I like the use of the 2d array, Im assuming its for storing the numbers
thats a problem that I hadn't thought about yet. Looks really good

deck
* Everyone looks good but the index variable for print. I beleive that its supposed
to be a int so that you can specify a specific card being printed.

UserInterface
* Unless your implementation had changed from the starter code you forgot the run() function
 I like that you added the string option to your getIntegerInput function to allow for a prompt.

menu
* Looks good, really similiar to mine.

menu options
* Looks good

A few notes:
I dont think the Bingo.py is required but I don't think it hurts either.
The arrows are slightly confusing at first but overall make sense.

Overall a good uml.
