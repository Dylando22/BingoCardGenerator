Review: I think your UML diagram looks really good and neat! I think all of the classes with their objects and methods make sense and look good. I really like how you used semi-colons inside the method parameters to show their types. I also liked how you gave variable names to the return types. The arrows are kind of confusing, I think we used them in different ways. The way I used them was to show that one class is giving the objects and methods of another class. For example, a Deck needs cards, so the arrow shows Cards going into the Deck. This is just preference though. One thing I saw in another UML that I reviewed was that they put the "final" class at the bottom, and the most basic classes on the top, this really helped me visualize how the classes build onto each other. For example, NumberSet and MenuOption would be on top and the arrows would go down, until reaching UserInterface. This can also help you remember the flow of the program while designing and while implementing the design. One other suggestion I have is to simply start all your methods with lower case words (like you already have) and have all your variables or objects start with uppercase words. That way you can distinguish between the 2 easily. Overall, I think this is a good UML diagram. If you really wanted to, you could color coordinate all the classes, but other than that, I think this is good enough for a final diagram. Good job! 

Review: The diagram looks really neat and well put together. Anyone who looks at it can tell exactly how one class leads to the other. I really like how everything is symmetrical and there is a clear start and end point. One thing I would suggest is putting the starting classes (NumberSet and MenuOption) at the very top and then work your way down to Bingo. Also, in each method, specify exactly which type is needed for the inputs. This isn't necessary, but it can be very helpful when designing and working through the problems. Instead of having to go back and figure out which type is needed, you can go back and look at the chart. I also noticed that there are no "objects" in the classes, just methods. It can be helpful to show which objects belong in each class, for example "Deck" will have an object that will be a list/set/dictionary of cards. This also helps with understanding how the final program is going to run, and exactly what inputs, outputs and  variables will be needed in each class.  If you really wanted to make it look cool, you could color coordinate the different classes and their objects, and then when they are being used in other classes, you can clearly see where they come from. This would really help the reader understand how the NumberSet and MenuOption classes are related to the final product. Other than those suggestions, I think it is a very clean and successful UML diagram.
