Review: I think your UML diagram looks really good and neat! I think all of the classes with their objects and methods make sense and look good. I really like how you used semi-colons inside the method parameters to show their types. I also liked how you gave variable names to the return types. The arrows are kind of confusing, I think we used them in different ways. The way I used them was to show that one class is giving the objects and methods of another class. For example, a Deck needs cards, so the arrow shows Cards going into the Deck. This is just preference though. One thing I saw in another UML that I reviewed was that they put the "final" class at the bottom, and the most basic classes on the top, this really helped me visualize how the classes build onto each other. For example, NumberSet and MenuOption would be on top and the arrows would go down, until reaching UserInterface. This can also help you remember the flow of the program while designing and while implementing the design. One other suggestion I have is to simply start all your methods with lower case words (like you already have) and have all your variables or objects start with uppercase words. That way you can distinguish between the 2 easily. Overall, I think this is a good UML diagram. If you really wanted to, you could color coordinate all the classes, but other than that, I think this is good enough for a final diagram. Good job!
