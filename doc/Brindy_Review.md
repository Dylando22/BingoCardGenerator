Review: Your UML is nice and descriptive.  I think that any programmer who had your code side by side would understand what is going on.  I appreciate how you have notated everything that you need to.  I think that this will be a great addition to your plan and will really lay the ground work for it.  The thought that you have put into your UML will certainly assist you in your design and implementation. I like that you notated whether or not the method was private or public.  This will be very helpful in as you organize your design and begin writing your code.  It was smart to have all of the classes that are connected in anyway lead to each other. You can clearly see the relationships between the classes throughout your UML design.  This UML is thorough and very well thought out.  It is a little messy to look at, at first.  An easy amendment to this would be to spread out the boxes more, just so that it doesn't look quite so crowded.  This will make it much softer on the eyes, and easy to see everything at a glance.  My other suggestion would be to put "Bingo" somewhere that is a big more visible, just so that it is easier to read.  Once again, this will make it easier to follow.  Most, if not all, of these changes are not necessary, but may make it easier to read.  However, this is a really great first draft of your UML.
