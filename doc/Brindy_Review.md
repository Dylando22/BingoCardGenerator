Your UML is nice and descriptive.  I think that any programmer who had your code side by side would understand what is going on.  I appreciate how you have notated everything that you need to.  I think that this will be a great addition to your plan.  The thought that you have put into your UML will certainly assist you in your design and implementation. I like that you notated whether or not the method was private or public.  It was smart to have all of the classes that are connected lead to each other.  This UML is thorough and very well thought out.  It is a little messy to look at, at first.  My only suggestion would be to put "Bingo" somewhere that is a big more visible, just so that it is easier to read. Most, if not all, of these changes are not necessary, but may make it easier to read.
